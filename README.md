# Currency Recognition System for Blind Users

![Currency Recognition]

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **real-time currency recognition system** designed for visually impaired users. It utilizes **MobileNet with Edge AI and TensorFlow Lite** to classify different currencies and provides **text-to-speech (TTS) feedback** to announce the denomination. Additionally, it includes **money management** features to help users track their cash transactions efficiently.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time currency recognition** using **MobileNet and TensorFlow Lite**
- **Edge AI** for on-device processing, ensuring fast and offline functionality
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** conversion to announce the detected currency
- **Multi-currency support** (customizable based on region)
- **Money management** tools to track and manage cash transactions
- **User-friendly interface** for seamless navigation
- **Optimized for Android** using **React Native**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native
- **Machine Learning Model:** MobileNet + TensorFlow Lite
- **Edge AI:** Optimized for on-device inference
- **Text-to-Speech:** Android TTS API / Google Text-to-Speech
- **Platform:** Android

## 📱 How It Works
1. **Capture** an image of the currency using the phone camera.
2. **Process** the image with MobileNet + TensorFlow Lite for classification.
3. **Recognize** the denomination and provide instant voice feedback using TTS.
4. **Log** transactions for money management (optional feature).

## 🏗️ Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Android device with a camera
- Node.js & npm installed
- React Native environment set up


## 🧪 Model Training & Optimization
- The currency recognition model is trained using **MobileNet** with a dataset of various currency denominations.
- **TensorFlow Lite** is used to optimize the model for real-time inference.
- Post-processing involves integrating Edge AI for efficient on-device classification.

## 📊 Performance Metrics
- **Inference Speed:** ~X ms per image
- **Accuracy:** ~X% (Varies based on dataset and lighting conditions)
- **Latency:** Minimal due to Edge AI processing

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Expand to support more currencies worldwide.
- Improve accuracy with better dataset augmentation.
- Integrate haptic feedback for an enhanced experience.
- Develop an iOS version.

## 💡 Why This Project?
Visually impaired individuals face difficulties in recognizing currency notes. This project provides an **efficient, fast, and offline-capable** solution to empower them with financial independence.
